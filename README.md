# Final Integrated Project
This Final Integrated Project is a collaborative or solo web development project focused on building a professional-grade, three-page website for a chosen brand or product. The goal is to simulate an industry-standard workflow, delivering a fully functional, visually engaging, and user-friendly web experience. Each site must include an index.html file, as well as a contact form integrated into one of the pages. The project is designed to reinforce both technical and collaborative skills, reflecting real-world industry practices and emphasizing self-guided learning and experimentation.

## Installation

For users: No installation is required. Just open index.html in a browser.

## Features
Three Fully Designed Pages:
A complete site built for a brand/product, including homepage, additional content page(s), and a contact form.

Contact Form:
